<h1>CatMemeOfTheDay</h1>

This is a simple project I wrote to display a random cat meme on an Adafruit ili9341 display (used originally for
a different project). A cron job runs on the pi to run the script again every 5 minutes.

Images were sourced from different Instagram accounts using the Instaloader tool.
